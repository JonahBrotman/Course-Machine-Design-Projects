# Course-Machine-Design-Projects
The complete project for MECH 323 - Machine Design, completed in my third year of Mechanical Engineering at Queen's University.

The project consisted of working in a team of 5 to complete a "Gear Box Assembly" Design.

Four types of components were designed and analyzed: Gears, shafts, housing, and bearings.

The preliminary design consisted of:
- Producing a preliminary design of the entire gearbox assembly.
- Determining the gear ratios for the Top Speed and Hill Climb tests through simulations completed in python.
- Determining the numbers of teeth for each gear in the gear train.
- Selecting the basic shaft layout based on the provided size constraints of the gear box, gears, and shafts.
